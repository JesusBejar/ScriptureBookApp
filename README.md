This is a simple scripture reading app made using Java + Spring Boot 3! 
The app fetches Bible books, chapters, and verses from this API - https://bible-api.com/?ref=public_apis&utm_medium=website
Here are my classes (for now)
* class Library 
    - ScriptureBook
* class ScriptureBook
    - name
    - numOfBook
    - Books
* class Book 
    - name
    - numOfChapter
    - Chapter
* class Chapter
    - author
    - numOfVerses
    - verseText

And here are my functions:
* function fetchText
* function formatText
* function displayText
* function handleClick

Here are the 4 OOP principles and my description for how my program follows them - 
Abstraction - 
Encapsulation -
Inheritance -
Polymorphism -
